# BI-AG2

These are my solutions for the problems given
in the Algorithms and Graphs 2 subject at CTU FIT in 2022/2023.
Both were the fastest solutions submitted in that semester.

## hw01
Problem of finding strongly connected components.

## hw02
Finding of the smallest cut in a flow network.
Implemented using Ford-fulkerson (in fact Edmonds-Karp) algorithm,
Dinitz and Pushâ€“relabel (Goldberg) algoritm.
